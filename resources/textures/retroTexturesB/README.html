<h1>N64 Texture Pack B</h1>

<p>A retro texture pack in the style of the Nintendo 64, particularly the early headline games such as Super Mario 64 or Ocarina of Time.

<p>These textures are deliberately drawn at a very low resolution, about 32x32, which is approximately the size used by the games when originally released. They are also quite simplistic and lacking in much aesthetic appeal, but this is deliberate, so that they can appeal to people's nostalgia or desire for something less perfect than modern graphics.

<p>These textures are not quite pixel art, and to imitate the Nintendo 64 they are meant to be stretched across models without much concern for the appearance of being stretched. They should be rendered using bilinear or trilinear filtering or some other filtering method that "melts" the pixels slightly, but not using nearest-neighbour, as that is more suited for pixel art.

<p>Most of these textures are suitable for texture tiling, and where they are meant to be tiled, they are seamless.

<p>Most textures were produced using Aseprite in combination with a drawing tablet for "soft" pixel work. The GUI textures (in their own folder) were made using Filter Forge, which I find quite useful for the production of N64 textures as the low resolution allows less concern over detail. Blender was used for the demo images.

<p>Enjoy!
